The "ext_oneshot" folder is intended for use in radio messages and such. It has
extra audio trim all the way to 30 seconds. When these are used in the
chatterSound parameter of a radio message, it should only play the sound once
due to the length *generally* being higher than a radio message (only extreme
cases may have a single message longer than 30s, causing the sound to loop)

The "standard" folder is just the ripped audio from the game in ogg format.
