```diff
+ Appended a custom ship for Spirit Guardians. (PROGRESS: 4 / 8 SHIPS)
+ Appended some codex entries for Spirit Guardians. (PROGRESS: 2 / 10 STORIES)
+ Appended a generic Spirit Guardian tenant (The three default ones are characters created by the original designers of the mod, and had their own special appearance. This one is ... generic!)
