"Entry #1, made on the 3rd of January 2452.

Today is an exciting day. Today I graduated from the Terrene Protectorate College! I have decided that I will start logging my experiences and adventures in this book. I hope to be able to pass down my experiences to my kin through this diary."

"Entry #2, made on the 4th of January 2452.

About four hours after the ceremony yesterday, the ^#EBBE0E;Grand Protector^reset; had requested my presence. It startled me; I wasn't sure why she wanted to see me. When I arrived in her office, she was very welcoming. She was very direct, quick to make her statements. It turns out that she wanted to mention to me how special it was that I was a graduate of the Terrene Protectorate Wayfinder Subdivision. I initially was uncertain of why my graduation was any more valuable than anyone else's, and when I spoke of this concern, she emphasised something that was almost embarrasing for me to not realize: not very many Spirit Guardians choose to go the route of the adventurer. She was right. Most of us prefer to settle down somewhere and make what we have the best it can possibly be! Being a Wayfinder was a rare sight for my kind.

She continued by pointing out that my native behavior as a Spirit Guardian is a ^#AAFFFF;\"flawless example of what The Protectorate strives to be.\"^reset;. When she said this, I couldn't help but to feel a certain warmth. She was right. We Spirit Guardians are very docile, friendly, and most importantly peaceful. Before dismissing me, she walked in front of me and grabbed my hand. The words she spoke are words I will never forget. 

^#AAFFFF;\"When you use a peaceful nature for your actions, you have more power than any person or force in the known universe\"^reset;, she said. ^#AAFFFF;\"I have no doubts that you will become a shining example of not only The Protectorate's goals, but you will also be a wayward star for all people in this universe. Never let anything bring you down, Eda\"^reset;. I was moved, speechless.

She walked back to her desk and sat down, gesturing that I was free to go with a smile. As I moved to leave the room, we exchanged a silent gratitude for eachother. Nothing was spoken, no communication done at all, but I know for certain that we both had that warm feeling that words can't seem to explain.",

"Entry #3, made on the 16th of July 2452.

A couple months ago, I was put into training and registered as a crew member of the T.P.E Avalon, a large exploration ship designed for prolonged microgravity. One week ago, training finished. Today, we embark on our eight year mission to explore new worlds. It's hard to believe that the day has finally come.

I'm excited for our journey, I can't wait to see what's out there, who we will meet, and what we will find. I'm also quite nervous, but I think we all are. We're going into the great unknown. Space is very dangerous, after all...

--
Post-script: I thought I was done with today's log but something ... legendary... happened. I'm in my quarters and we just left Earth, and as I watched the world get smaller and smaller, a primal sense awoke. Could it really be ^#99BBFF;Him^reset;? ^#99BBFF;The Spirit Tree^reset;, connected to me over this vast space? I want to cry. I can almost feel where Nibel is in this universe, like I could navigate there on my own. I will never let this feeling leave my mind. Ever.

"Entry #4, made on the 28th of June 2453.

It's been a long time since I last picked up this book. Almost a year, in fact. I've been so busy with duty that I haven't had time to write much here at all. Most of my logs are on the ship's computer since typing is so much faster.

Something special happened earlier today. We came across a Protectorate establishment. This was an entire colony, not just another outpost or settlement. When we arrived, I noted that a lot of ships were moored in the docks, but they looked like their engines hadn't been fired ... ever, really. Usually they don't allow ships to stay in a dock for longer than four weeks. I wonder why they're there?

Perhaps they allowed prolonged docking here. The Captain said that we would be here for a few months before we continued with the remaining seven years of our mission.",

I can't believe it! I'm so excited! So it turns some of those ships that looked dormant were actualy ships they were selling to travellers. And even better, they had a ship designed by my people! An authentic Spirit Guardian ship! It's a small Tier 1 design. But that's not all...

THEY GAVE IT TO ME FOR ONLY 50000 PIXELS!!! It was almost too good to be true! I validated it myself three times over. The ship is in mint condition, fresh out of the shop. I can't thank them enough.  ...Is it possible that the ^#EBBE0E;Grand Protector^reset; was behind this?...

After speaking with the captain and some higher ranking individuals, they authorized me to start a derivative exploration mission since this colony was directly connected to Earth via a teleporter array. This would mean that the colony would be my returning point. There's no way that this would have been authorized normally. The ^#EBBE0E;Grand Protector^reset; has to be behind this without a doubt! I can't wait to fly my new ship.",

"Entry #6, made on the 16th of January 2453.

The new year passed just recently, and today's the first day of my own trip. All of the logs I made on the previous ship were copied over to this one, and the ship's SAIL synchronised with my own via a long range communications system. This would allow us to talk to eachother. I'm glad I can still talk to my fellow crew members.

Today is not just the first day of any adventure, however. I didn't forget that fateful day on the 16th of July of last year. Somehow, that feeling remains fresh in my heart. I'm going to Nibel. I didn't tell this to anyone, nor did I have to. The world is registered on the longlist of Protectorate Ally Homeworlds, but I don't want to automate the process. I want to be able to go there myself.

--
Post-script: After going into manual pilot mode, my SAIL asked me what I was doing. I told him my plans, and he strongly advised not navigating there manually. I told him that I knew where home was. I still want to try.. And if I go the wrong way, well, I can just use the computer anyway.",

"Entry #7, made on the 31st of August 2455.

I have been doing short range jumps towards Nibel, and my mind still says I'm getting closer and closer. My SAIL decided to spoil the fun and say that I was indeed going the right way ... for the most part. My deviation was around 1%, so no biggie. So much for not having computer assistance...

I'm about half way through my Erchius Fuel reservoirs. I can't be much further off. My SAIL says that taking jumps in steps uses more fuel. Maybe I should do longer jumps?",

**Page 8:**
"Entry #8, made on the 20th of November 2455.

I'm almost out of Erchius Fuel. I've gone into orbit around a moon that my SAIL says is \"rich with Erchius Fuel, both crystal and liquid.\". He warned me of some recent issues at various mining facilities involving the effects of Erchius to living creatures. I'm scared, but he ensures that if I am fast enough, I can get the fuel and leave. I've decided that it's best for me to navigate to the world via computer from this point on. It was stupid of me to try to do it manually.",

**Page 9:**
"Entry #9, made on the 21st of November 2455.

I tried to make the jump, but of course, my warp drive went critical and had to be ejected from the ship entirely. I suppose that's what I get for constantly starting and stopping it. There's a lush world in this system and I can use my impulse engines to get into orbit. I just hope there's someone there that can help...",

"Entry #10, made on the 22nd of November 2455.

I'm exploring this world. It's fairly serene. I came across a small village of Avians. I asked if they had a teleporter. They didn't, but they said there was a gate nearby that would lead me to \"The Outpost\". I've heard of that place through the rumblings of various explorers back on Earth. They gave me twenty core fragments after some negotiation, and I went off to go activate this \"gate\". The outpost is not that big but it's got some great people. Thankfully, there was this little chop shop called \"Penguin Pete's\". They said they could repair my warp drive. After paying them a hefty amount of pixels - Almost half of what I paid for the ship - they installed a new warp drive.

I never really appreciated my ship enough after that first week of flying it. The teleporter on it is modeled after a ^#00EEFF;Spirit Well^reset;, which makes me feel a bit better about being in the depths of space. I am now on board and have resumed my course. It's so far away.",

"Entry #11, made on the 12th of February 2456.

I made it!!! It's really here! I can't wait to see it. It's home -- the real one. I'll be there in a matter of minutes.

--
I am now on the surface of Nibel. Almost immediately the world seemed to recognize me, and my connection to ^#99BBFF;The Spirit Tree^reset; felt stronger than ever.

--
I just went over a small foothill, and ^#99BBFF;The Spirit Tree^reset; came into view. I've never seen a tree so huge. The blue energy radiating from ^#99BBFF;His^reset; roots almost seemed to call to me. I've asked mt SAIL to log everything in my ship's archives.

--
I just came across some fellow Spirits. They greeted me in our native tongue. Unfortunately I'm not very fluent, which was quite embarrasing. Luckily, the common language used by The Protectorate was in their vocabulary as well. I was relieved. I asked them to direct me to the nearest ^#00EEFF;Spirit Well^reset; so that I could register it as a teleporter. The technology on my ship was designed to work with our kind. After I made it to the well, I saw a notable difference. The one in my ship looked almost identical, but this one had something more to it. Its authenticity was showing in some manner that couldn't be seen. My SAIL notified me that it could bookmark this place, and I instantly approved. I was now able to use the ENTIRE network of Spirit Wells both inside and outside of Nibel! This is amazing.",

"Entry #12, made on the 7th of March 2456.

I feel sick. I was asleep in a home I recently designed within a cave here on Nibel when my SAIL woke me up. Last night I told him I wanted to return to Earth, potentially bringing a few of my recently acquired friends along for the ride. We were going to use the nearby ^#00EEFF;Spirit Well^reset; to get there.

...Except now, our plans have changed indefinitely. My SAIL informed me of something that I can't come to believe... Could it really be true? .... Earth? Destroyed?...
