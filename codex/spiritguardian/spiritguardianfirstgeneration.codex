"Today marks a very important event on Nibel, an event comparable to the importance of Ori's story.

\"Will ^#99BBFF;He^reset; still feel my presence while I'm so far away\"? I have no doubt that this very question was passing through all of our minds, sitting here in this space ship. The stars are empty, sparse... It's the opposite of the forests we all know by heart. \"How bad could it really be?\" we all thought. We had the optimism required to complete the task of making it out there, at least. Our destination was a world called \"Earth\". This place is where the Terrene Protectorate was created.",


"When The Protectorate arrived at our home, we did not know how to feel. We felt fear, in a way, for we had never heard of the races that made up The Protectorate. However, through time, we had a firm understanding that they are peaceful just as we are. When we realized their intent, it felt like even ^#99BBFF;He^reset; welcomed them to Nibel...

After being here for a little more than five summers, teaching us about technology, the universe, and what their order was about, The Protectorate finally decided to bestow a gift upon us: They provided us a place in their order, granting us the designs to technology that would allow us to visit the skies above. Many of us weren't sure if we should even use it or not, more, if we were even capable of creating the technology in the first place...",

"When they granted us these such advanced designs, I silently wondered how many people thought of the long-lost Gumon. Would we already be exploring the stars if they still walked the mountains of Nibel...? When Ori activated their ruins, kicking their technology back into life, He simultaneously created a way to explore their complex home. Ever since the revival of Nibel, we have held it as a memorial to their kind.

...I wonder what the Gumon were like...?",


"Shortly after they had given us their gift, we decided that it was time to give them our own as a courtesy: We allowed them to understand our connection to ^#99BBFF;The Spirit Tree^reset;, to understand how our ^#00EEFF;Light Vessels^reset; and ^#00EEFF;Spirit Wells^reset; work, that they were powered by our very essence. They were quite fascinated, even calling it \"magical\" despite their orientation to technology. Dare I say, we may have made some rethink the existence of their own deities when we showed them the power of our unity.",


"We are launching now. This is the last page I can write, as I must prepare for the journey ahead.

Goodbye, Nibel. Perhaps we will soon visit you again.
