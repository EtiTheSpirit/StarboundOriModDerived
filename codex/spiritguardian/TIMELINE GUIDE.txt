PREFACE:

	In derived lore between Ori and Starbound, for lack of official information aside from lengths of time, I have decided to take a timeline into my own hand.

	I would like to find a community of modders with lore that has an established timeline to fit my own into so that we can have a common timeline across everything.

	If you are a well-known modder and know of a community like this, or want to begin one, please consider contacting me.
