# How to download
This is now on the Steam Workshop!

* **<a href="steam://url/CommunityFilePage/1614494395">steam://url/CommunityFilePage/1614494395</a>** (Paste this into the browser search bar to open in Steam. Github won't recognize this as a url, even if I use html tags (which would work, but Github decided that I can't do that))

# Important Notice
This mod **is not mine.** The original can be found [on the Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1485177055). This repository features my own edits and updates to this mod. All mod data mentioned in the Changes/Plans section is stuff I've worked on unless explicitly mentioned otherwise. Everything else is from the original creators.

## What exactly is different?
I've appended some custom stuff to the existing mod. See [Patches.md](https://github.com/XanTheDragon/StarboundOriModDerived/blob/master/Patches.md) to read the changelogs.
