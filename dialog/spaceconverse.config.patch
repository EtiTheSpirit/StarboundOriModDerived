				"Welcome, friend. You won't see any trouble from me, I'm glad to see a new face.",
				"What brings you here, traveller? If it's simply to visit, then you have my gratitude; it's been lonely.",
				"Are you here to visit? Will you stay? ...Sorry. It's exciting to see a new person, is all.",
				"I wish space was more like the forest, with a wondeful network of branches to explore. This emptiness is .. odd. Do you like it?",
				"Hi! Please, take your time. It's great to have visitors. It gets lonely at times.",
				"Hello friend. It's nice to meet a new person. I hope you stay for a while."

				"Hello! I'm so glad to see a fellow spirit. Do you enjoy the stars?",
				"Fellow guardian! How have you been? I hope you've done well, space is a ... troublesome place.",
				"People are always so fascinated to see our kind. I suppose they have reason. Technology is the opposite of nature.",
				"I see that I am not the only one who has taken to adventuring the skies. Welcome, friend.",
				"It's great to see another face. I am <selfname>, it's nice to have you here.",
				"What's this? Another guardian? Welcome! I do hope you've found space more interesting than I have. There's no trees.",
				"Hello, spirit. I'm relieved, I thought I would never see another one of our kind again... Welcome."
