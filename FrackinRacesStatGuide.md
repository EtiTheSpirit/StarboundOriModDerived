# Frackin' Races Stat Reference Sheet

Here, you can see the stats for the Spirit Guardian race.

Spirit Guardians exhibit incredible mobility bonuses due to their incredibly lightweight nature. They practically drift through the air.

Their physical movement abilities do grant them the ability to defend themselves using this mobility (e.g. certain in-game capabilities like Bash (kicking off of objects or enemies) and Stomp (propelling themselves into the ground)). However, in the scope of damage not stemming from intentional impacts or falling, they are unable to endure.

Most abilities in the source game are oriented to mobility. Refer to this YouTube video for an example of mobility: https://youtu.be/tEm3Ndz87Zw
