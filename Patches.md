# Version 1.8.3
Released 24 Feb 2020 at 2:21 AM Central

# Version 1.4.4
Release date not logged.

```diff
+ Appended "spiritguardianlight" item that can be handcrafted for 15 pixels + 10 plant fibre. This is a crafting item
+ Appended function to "spiritshard" item. Crafted with 10 spiritguardianlight. Used to create spiritbow, spiritdagger, spiritbroadsword, spiritshield, and lightvessel

# Version 1.4.3b
Release date not logged.

## Changes
```diff
+ Released three codex entries. These are not in any treasure pools (So you can't get them through normal means). For those who are antsy to read, the item names are "spiritguardianfirstgeneration-codex", "spiritguardiandiary0-codex", "spiritguardianscience0-codex"
* Improved tech screen images again. Should be easier to look at.
* Improved indev ship designs and collision. The ships have not released yet but the files are there if you want to look at them.
* Appended a prototype indev behavior modifier for Erchius Ghosts and the Spooked effect. There is a test status effect that prevents ghosts from spawning, and if one already exists then they can't damage you. This is marked as a change (rather than an addition) because it's not fully ready, but it works. The item name that does this is `spiritguardiantesthead`
```

## Known Bugs

```diff
+ Started work on a soon-to-be-added prototype respawn that's really rough around the edges and doesn't work at all. Files are there still if you are so inclined to see the work so far.
* Edited teleportation and mech drop pod effects. Teleportation now has a noisy appearance inside of it (makes it look a bit more unique) and the mech drop pod is a bit more green/blue in its color, and also has lines of energy traversing it.
```

+ Added a species effect called spiritguardianglow. This effect causes the player to emit light.
* Fixed a bug causing NPCs to die if you talk to them. This patch does not include the fenerox, as they have a unique handler that I've still not managed to fix.
```
