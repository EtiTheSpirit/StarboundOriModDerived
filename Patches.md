# Version 1.4.9
Released 26 Mar 2019 at 3:40 PM Central

## Changes
```diff
+ Added a new song file for in-game instruments written by Mois√©s Nieto (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njEycbetcmY). Thanks to him for giving me the MIDI.

* Improved grammar in various lore-based codex entries.
* Added racial tagging to codex entries as well as categories for the codex viewer if you have Extended GUI or anything.
* Changed the writing of codex entries to use arbitrary time rather than a made-up Earth-based timescale since there is no official backing lore for this.
* Added extra stats to the Frackin Races patch. See below.
- Removed Datacube style cover for credits codex, made a more cohesive image (It was being used as a placeholder)
```

# Version 1.4.4
Release date not logged.

## Changes
```diff
+ Appended "spiritguardianlight" item that can be handcrafted for 15 pixels + 10 plant fibre. This is a crafting item
+ Appended function to "spiritshard" item. Crafted with 10 spiritguardianlight. Used to create spiritbow, spiritdagger, spiritbroadsword, spiritshield, and lightvessel
+ Appended "lightvessel" item. This has no use for the moment, but will be used to craft end-game items.
+ Appended new sounds for Spirit Torches ripped from Ori.
+ Appended recipes for "spiritdagger" and "spiritshield" items.
+ Appended sounds for spiritshield.

# Version 1.4.3c
Release date not logged.

## Changes

+ Appended new sounds for a new respawn idea. This respawn is, as usual, not implemented yet.
* Fixed up some of the codex writing.
```

## Known Bugs
 * None

# Version 1.4.3b
Release date not logged.

## Changes
```diff
+ Released three codex entries. These are not in any treasure pools (So you can't get them through normal means). For those who are antsy to read, the item names are "spiritguardianfirstgeneration-codex", "spiritguardiandiary0-codex", "spiritguardianscience0-codex"
* Improved tech screen images again. Should be easier to look at.
* Improved indev ship designs and collision. The ships have not released yet but the files are there if you want to look at them.
* Appended a prototype indev behavior modifier for Erchius Ghosts and the Spooked effect. There is a test status effect that prevents ghosts from spawning, and if one already exists then they can't damage you. This is marked as a change (rather than an addition) because it's not fully ready, but it works. The item name that does this is `spiritguardiantesthead`
```

## Known Bugs
 * None

* Fixed the description of the Spirit Guardian flag (It used to show the standard protectorate description)
```

---
# Version 1.4.2
Release date not logged.

## Changes
```diff
+ Started work on a soon-to-be-added prototype respawn that's really rough around the edges and doesn't work at all. Files are there still if you are so inclined to see the work so far.
* Edited teleportation and mech drop pod effects. Teleportation now has a noisy appearance inside of it (makes it look a bit more unique) and the mech drop pod is a bit more green/blue in its color, and also has lines of energy traversing it.
```

## Known Bugs
 * Fenerox will still die if you talk to them. The reason is unknown. They have their own unique dialog handlers, but patches to them have failed to resolve the issue.

+ Added a species effect called spiritguardianglow. This effect causes the player to emit light.
* Fixed a bug causing NPCs to die if you talk to them. This patch does not include the fenerox, as they have a unique handler that I've still not managed to fix.
