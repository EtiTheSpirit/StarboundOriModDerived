If you're viewing this, congratulations! You've found my indev changelog.
Here, I store the changes I've made within my local copy of the mod so that I don't accidentally push something that's broken or incomplete.

>>> You may find things mentioned in here that are nowhere to be seen even in newer versions. Chances are, cut content will be kept in this list on accident, but the content itself will not be in files.

Right now:
	> New dialog for PassiveEvents + sound effects based on sein chatter. Todo: Implement sound?




SoonTM stuff:
v. INDEV-1.X Append prototype bash tech.
	> Upd. Very buggy and projectile detection lags + doesn't work
	> Upd. Very laggy still. May need to cut projectile detection.
	> Upd. Cut projectile detection, need to find a way to freeze stuff properly now.

v. INDEV-1.X Append mech prototype
	> Upd. Design shape based on forlorn ruins rocks
	> Upd. Pixel art delayed, being a pain in the ass
	> Upd. Implement weapon concepts
	
v. INDEV-1.X Append weapon `lightfist` based on `vinefist` weapon
	> Upd. Retextured existing vinefist weapon
	> Upd. Added new abilities, referenced sounds from sein attacks
	> Upd. Weapon causes crash when equipped, feeling lazy, will fix later
